This file currently serves as a placeholder for the execution workflow, 
which will eventually be moved here once refactoring progresses.

Given that this project was originally built several years ago, I can't precisely recall
how I had structured the workflow. Therefore, I'm reconstructing it by reviewing the code,
and temporarily documenting it here for reference.

Execution Workflow:

1 - A new instance of the NavigationRobot is created, receiving the following arguments:
    - Selenium WebDriver instance
    - A dictionary containing labels and paths for the data sources
    - CRM user and password credentials
    - An instance of the CustomerDataManager

2 - The `Autoexec` method is invoked on the newly created NavigationRobot instance.

3 - The `Autoexec` method performs the following steps:
    - Signs into the CRM platform.
    - Loads the required CRM tabs to enable order processing.
    - Calls the `NovoOrdersQueueAnalisis` method, which is the core processing loop.

4 - The `NovoOrdersQueueAnalisis` method operates as follows:
    - Continuously monitors the orders queue, waiting for new orders to become available for analysis.
    - Scans the orders queue table, extracting data for subsequent processing.
    - Opens each order's detail tab.
    - Queries the customer's data from the CustomerDataManager instance, retrieving previously computed credit decisions.
    - Evaluates additional conditions for each order.
    - Approves orders that comply with the credit policy.
    - Routes orders that are not eligible for automatic approval to manual review by a second-line analyst.

5 - This order analysis process is repeated as long as there are orders in the queue.
    When there are no pending orders, step 4 continues monitoring until new orders arrive.

Within step 4, instances of the `Order` object are created, specifically invoking its `FinalAnswer` method, as described below:

1 - `FinalAnswer` aggregates results from two methods: `CreditAnalysis` and `NonCreditAnalysis`. 
    These results are then adjusted to produce the final decision, which takes into account both credit risk and operational rules.

2 - The `CreditAnalysis` method handles specific customer profiles, 
    such as new customers lacking sufficient payment history, or those with known constraints (e.g., prior fraud).

3 - Within `CreditAnalysis`, the `AdjustedTrafficLight` method is invoked as needed.
    This method evaluates the core element of the credit policy at that time: a color-coded status indicating the customer's payment behavior.
    - Customers with no overdue payments are flagged as "Green".
    - Depending on the severity of overdue payments, customers may be flagged as "Yellow" or "Red".

4 - The `NonCreditAnalysis` method applies additional logic based on the selected payment method for the current order:
    - Credit card: bypasses credit analysis.
    - Cash or bank transfer: also bypasses credit analysis.
    - Check: requires manual evaluation.

*** Important: some payment method labels were adapted to the companyâ€™s internal conventions, 
so there is additional logic to ensure that the system behaves as expected. ***
